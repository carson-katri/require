# Require

You ever notice that you're building super long `guard` statements, or have tons of guards in a row?
```swift
guard let id = player.id, let name = player.name, let status = player.status else {
    throw "Player might be missing fields id, name, and/or status"
}
```
Instead of that, just `require` those fields:
```swift
let (id, name, status) = try require(from: player, \.id, \.name, \.status)
```
The `require` function creates those guards for you ðŸŽ‰

You can pass up to 10 KeyPaths.
